                <p>
                    By the end of this course, I want to be able to code and maintain my 
                    own portfolio website. I especially am interested in learning CSS and
                    implementing CSS styling into my code. I've got a lot of cool ideas, 
                    and I want to use this class as an opportunity to learn how to 
                    implement them.
                </p>

                    my favorite songs.
