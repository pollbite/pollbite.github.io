    <h1>Thelyphonida</h1>

    <!-- general description paragraph -->
    <p>
      Thelyphonida is an
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnid">arachnid</a> order
      comprising invertebrates commonly known as whip scorpions or vinegaroons
      (also spelled vinegarroons and vinegarones). They are often called
      uropygids in the scientific community based on an alternative name for the
      order, Uropygi (which may then also include the order Schizomida). The
      name "whip scorpion" refers to their resemblance to true scorpions and
      possession of a whiplike tail, and "vinegaroon" refers to their ability
      when attacked to discharge an offensive, vinegar-smelling liquid, which
      contains acetic acid.

      Carl Linnaeus first described a whip scorpion in 1758, although he did not
      distinguish it from what are now regarded as different kinds of arachnid,
      calling it <i>Phalangium caudatum</i>. <i>Phalangium</i> is now used as a
      name for a genus of harvestmen (Opiliones). In 1802, Pierre André
      Latreille was the first to use a genus name solely for whip scorpions,
      namely <i>Thelyphonus</i>. Latreille later explained the name as meaning
      "<i>qui tue</i>", meaning "who kills". One name for the order,
      Thelyphonida, is based on Latreille's genus name. It was first used (with
      the spelling Thelyphonidea) by O. P. Cambridge in 1872.
    </p>

    <p>
      The name "uropygid" means "tail rump", from Ancient Greek οὐροπύγιον
      (<i>ouropugion</i>), from οὐρά (<i>oura</i>) "tail" and πυγή (<i>puge</i>)
      "rump" referring to the whip-like flagellum on the end of the pygidium, a
      small plate made up of the last three segments of the abdominal
      exoskeleton.
    </p>

    <p>
      The classification and scientific name used for whip scorpions varies.
      Originally, Amblypygi (whip spiders), Thelyphonida and Schizomida
      (short-tailed whipscorpions) formed a single order of arachnids,
      Pedipalpi. Pedipalpi was later divided into two orders, Amblypygi and
      Uropygi (or Uropygida). Schizomida was then split off from Uropygi into a
      separate order. The remainder has either continued to be called by the
      same name, Uropygi, possibly distinguished as Uropygi
      <i>sensu stricto</i>, or called Thelyphonida. Other sources do not accept
      the split, and continue to treat Schizomida as part of Uropygi.
      Phylogenetic studies show the three orders to be closely related, and the
      older order names may now be used as names for clades, as shown below. The
      Schizomida and Thelyphonida likely diverged in the late Carboniferous,
      somewhere in the tropics of Pangaea.

    <hr />

    <p>
      Whip scorpions range from 25 to 85 mm (1.0 to 3.3 in) in length, with most
      species having a body no longer than 30 mm (1.2 in); the largest species,
      of the genus <i>Mastigoproctus</i>, can reach 85 mm (3.3 in). An extinct
      <i>Mesoproctus</i> from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation could be the
      same size. Because of their legs, claws, and "whip", though, they can
      appear much larger, and the heaviest specimen weighed was 12.4 grams (0.44
      oz).
    </p>

    <p>
      Like the related orders Schizomida and Amblypygi, the vinegaroons use only
      six legs for walking, with the first two legs serving as antennae-like
      sensory organs. All species also have very large scorpion-like pedipalps
      (pincers) but there is an additional large spine on each palpal tibia.
      They have one pair of eyes at the front of the cephalothorax and three on
      each side of the head, a pattern also found in scorpions. Vinegaroons have
      no venom glands, but they have glands near the rear of their abdomen that
      can spray a combination of acetic acid and caprylic acid when they are
      bothered. The acetic acid gives this spray a vinegar-like smell, giving
      rise to the common name <i>vinegaroon</i>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="behaviour">Behaviour</h2>

    <hr />

    <p>
      Vinegaroons are carnivorous, nocturnal hunters feeding mostly on insects,
      millipedes, scorpions, and terrestrial isopods, but sometimes on worms and
      slugs. Mastigoproctus sometimes preys on small vertebrates. The prey is
      crushed between special teeth on the inside of the trochanters (the second
      segment of the "legs") of the front appendages. They are valuable in
      controlling the population of cockroaches and crickets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Males secrete a spermatophore (a united mass of sperm), which is
      transferred to the female following courtship behaviour, in which the male
      holds the ends of the female's first legs in his chelicerae. The
      spermatophore is deposited on the ground and picked up by the female using
      her genital area. In some genera, the male then uses his pedipalps to push
      the spermatophore into her body.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a few months, the female will dig a large burrow and seal herself
      inside. Up to 40 eggs are extruded, within a membranous broodsac that
      preserves moisture and remains attached to the genital operculum and the
      fifth segment of the mother's ventral opisthosoma. The female refuses to
      eat and holds her opisthosoma in an upward arch so that the broodsac does
      not touch the ground for the next few months, as the eggs develop into
      postembryos. Appendages become visible.
    </p>

    <p>
      The white young that hatch from the postembryos climb onto their mother's
      back and attach themselves there with special suckers. After the first
      molt, when they look like miniature adults but with bright red palps, they
      leave the burrow. The mother may live up to two more years. The young grow
      slowly, going through four molts in about four years before reaching
      adulthood. They live for up to another four years.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      Whip scorpions are found in tropical and subtropical areas excluding
      Europe and Australia. Also, only a single species is known from Africa:
      <i>Etienneus africanus</i>, probably a Gondwana relict endemic to Senegal,
      the Gambia and Guinea-Bissau. They usually dig burrows with their
      pedipalps, to which they transport their prey. They may also burrow under
      logs, rotting wood, rocks, and other natural debris. They prefer humid,
      dark places and avoid light. <i>Mastigoproctus giganteus</i>, the giant
      whip scorpion, is found in more arid areas, including Arizona and New
      Mexico.
